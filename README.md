# Support Ticket Classification System (Task 2)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Future Interns – Machine Learning Internship (Task 2)**.

The goal of this project is to build a **Machine Learning system** that automatically:
- Classifies customer support tickets into categories
- Assigns priority levels (High / Medium / Low)

This helps support teams respond faster and more efficiently.
